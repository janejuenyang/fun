# IL Primary 2022

On June 28, 2022, Illinois held its mid-term primaries. I worked on [Hoan Huynh's campaign for District 13 State House Representative](https://votehoan.com/) and he won the Democratic primary! There were five candidates and I wanted to understand how the votes broke down by precinct and ward.
