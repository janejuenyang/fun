# Chicago Municipal Elections

Chicago holds elections every four years. As I canvassed for 46th ward aldermanic candidate [Angela Clay](https://angelafor46.com/) for the 2023 election, I wanted to get a better understanding of how precincts voted in 2019. Chicago consolidated precincts in 2020 so the analysis required finding overlaps between the previous and current borders.
